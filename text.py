textLabels['beginlearn'] = "To begin using your new TouchType you will need to teach it a unique combination of depressed fingers for each letter in the alphabet. When a letter is shown on the screen, depress the combination fingers that you want to represent that letter and hold for three seconds. Press any finger to begin"

textlabels['teach1'] = "Great! Now that you have taught your TouchType what fingers represent what letter, it is time for you to learn the combinations yourself. To assist with this process, your new TouchType features vibrational stimulators in each finger. This technology makes learning muscle memory fast and easy! We will practice now. For each letter shown on the screen, depress the fingers you feel buzzing. These are the fingers corresponding to that letter. Simply press these fingers down for three seconds and the next letter will be shown. In addition, you will see a diagram of circles representing your fingers with the fingers you should depress shaded in red. Press any finger to begin."

textlabels['teach2'] = "Now that you have practiced with the buzzer, lets see if you can do it without it. For each letter you see on the screen, press the corresponding combination of fingers for three seconds. If you forget, look at diagram on the screen. It is a series of circles representing your fingers with the fingers you should depress shaded in red. Press any finger to begin."

textlabels['begintest'] = "OK. Now for the big test. Lets see how well you have learned to use your TouchType. For each letter shown on the screen, depress the corresponding combination of fingers for three seconds. Press any finger to begin."

textLabels['failtest'] = "It looks like you need a little more practice. Lets go through the learning process again.  Press any finger to begin."
textLabels['passtest'] = "Congrats! You have mastered your new TouchType and are ready to begin using it to type faster then you ever thought possible. Enjoy!"
